## Highlights

* Mask-Adapter is a simple yet remarkably effective method and can be seamlessly integrated into open-vocabulary segmentation methods, e.g., [FC-CLIP](https://github.com/bytedance/fc-clip) and [MAFT-Plus](https://github.com/jiaosiyu1999/MAFT-Plus), to tackle the existing bottlenecks.

* Mask-Adapter effectively extends to SAM without training, achieving impressive results across multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.
